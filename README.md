## About me
I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student at Concordia University in Montreal. I am very passionate about Machine Learning, Game Development, as well as Web Development.
I love to create new projects and see how new technology works. As well as being a University student, I have also had some industry experience with an internship with a company called Consoltec.
